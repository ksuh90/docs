Utility types are helper functions and types that live on the Prisma namespace. They are useful for keeping your application type safe.

## [<inlinecode>Prisma.validator</inlinecode>](../concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/#prisma-validator)

The `validator` helps you create re-usable query parameters based on your schema models while making sure that the objects you create are valid.

The following example shows how you can extract a `create` operation into a custom function for re-use and accepting form data.

To access the `validator` you must import the Prisma namespace.

```ts
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

const createUserAndPost = (name: string, email: string, postTitle: string, profileBio: string) => {
  return Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserCreateInput>()({
    name,
    email,
    posts: {
      create: {
        title: postTitle,
      },
    },
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: profileBio,
      },
    },
  })
}
```
